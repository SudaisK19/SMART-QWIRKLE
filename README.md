## Description

Smart Qwirkle is an enhanced version of the classic Qwirkle board game, featuring:

* **Hexagonal Grid**: Axialâ€‘coordinate layout for six directions of play.
* **AI Opponents**: Three difficulty levelsâ€”Easy (uninformed search), Medium (heuristic evaluation), Hard (Minimax + alphaâ€‘beta pruning).
* **Powerâ€‘Ups**: Strategic tiles (UNDO, DOUBLE, WILD) that alter scoring and placement rules.
* **Interactive UI**: Built with Python and Pygame for dragâ€‘andâ€‘drop tile placement and realâ€‘time feedback.

---

## Features

* **Hexagonal Board**: Flexible placement along six axes.
* **Rule Enforcement**: Matches by color or shape, with full validation and scoring (including +6 bonus for a complete line of six).
* **AI Strategy**: Adjustable AI opponents to suit beginners up to advanced players.
* **Powerâ€‘Ups**:

  * **UNDO**: Revert the last move.
  * **DOUBLE**: Double your score for a turn.
